# Installation & Run

## Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- Terminal with ANSI color support  

## Compile and Run
```bash
javac -d bin src/Main.java src/common/*.java src/game/*.java \
src/utils/*.java src/items/*.java src/entities/*.java src/board/*.java

# Run after compiling
java -cp bin Main
```

# Design Pattern

The project follows a strict **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** inspired architecture with a **Template Method** pattern for the game loop.

### 1. Controller (`src/game/`)
- **Game.java**: Abstract template defining the `play()` lifecycle.  
- **LegendsGame.java**: Concrete implementation managing the RPG flow and UI rendering.  
- **BattleController.java**: Handles turn-based combat logic.  
- **MarketController.java**: Handles buying/selling logic.  

### 2. Model (`src/entities/` & `src/items/`)
- **Hero**, **Monster**, **Party**: Data structures for characters.  
- **Weapon**, **Armor**, **Spell**, **Potion**: Inventory items using Polymorphism.  

### 3. View/Board (`src/board/`)
- **LegendsBoard**: Renders the grid state to the console with ANSI colors.  
- **Cell**: Represents individual tiles.  

### 4. Utilities (`src/utils/` & `src/common/`)
- **GameDataLoader**: Factory pattern to parse `.txt` data files.  
- **InputValidator**: Static helper for safe user input.  
- **RandomGenerator**: Singleton for consistent random number generation.
